H&M Group is a family of brands and businesses with 53 online markets and approximately 4,850 stores. Our online store offers shoppers an extensive selection of products to browse through. But with too many choices, customers might not quickly find what interests them or what they are looking for, and ultimately, they might not make a purchase. To enhance the shopping experience, product recommendations are key. More importantly, helping customers make the right choices also has a positive implications for sustainability, as it reduces returns, and thereby minimizes emissions from transportation.

## Business Task
In this project, we aim to develop product recommendations based on data from previous transactions. 

We have attempted 3 different recommendation methods
 - Market Basket Analysis (What are the items frequently bought together?)
 - Content-Based Filtering (What are the items similar to what you have bought?)
 - Collaborative Filtering (What are the items that users with similar purchase history to yours have bought?)
